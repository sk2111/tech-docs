# Preface

Microservices are an approach to distributed systems that promote the use of finely grained services that can be changed, deployed, and released independently. For organizations moving towards a more loosely coupled systems, with autonomous teams delivering user-facing functionality, microservices work incredibly well.

Apart from this microservices gives us a huge number of options for building out systems, giving us a lot of flexiblity to ensure our system can change to meet the needs of the users.

Microservices aren't without downsides. As a distributed system, they bring a host of complexity.
