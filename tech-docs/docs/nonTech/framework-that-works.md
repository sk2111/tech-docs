# Life Framework That Works

## Tackle Recurring Tasks

In projects or life, there are often recurring tasks that need to be managed effectively.
Here’s a framework that can help you handle these tasks efficiently:

1. **Identify Recurring Tasks**: List out all tasks that you find yourself doing
   repeatedly. This could include daily, weekly, or monthly tasks.
2. **Prioritize Tasks**: Determine which tasks are most important or
   time-sensitive. This will help you focus on what needs to be done first.
3. **Create a Schedule**: Develop a schedule that outlines when each task
   should be completed. **The best you can use is calendar invites on a weekly
   & monthly basis.**
4. **Automate Where Possible**: Look for ways to automate tasks using tools or software.
   This could include setting reminders, using task management apps, or
   automating emails.
5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your task list and schedule.
   Adjust as necessary based on changes in priorities or new tasks that arise.
6. **Delegate**: If possible, delegate tasks to others to free up your time for
   more important activities.
7. **Reflect and Improve**: After completing tasks, take a moment to reflect
   on what worked well and what could be improved. Use this feedback to refine
   your approach for the future.
