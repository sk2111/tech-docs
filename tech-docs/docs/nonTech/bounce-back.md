## 🧘‍♂️ Recovery Protocol (When Spiraling)

1. Name the fear:
   “I’m afraid I’ll fail and it’ll mean I’m not good enough.”

2. Challenge the equation:
   “Failure ≠ unworthy. It’s just part of building skill.”

3. Recall proof:
   “I bounced back before. I learned new things, I shipped projects to millions
   of users.I’m learning fast.”

## 🧠 Success Reminder

"Success for me is showing up daily, learning intentionally, and recording every small win.
I don’t need to be perfect. I need to keep growing."
