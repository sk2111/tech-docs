# TCP Connections

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the core protocols of the Internet Protocol (IP) suite. It provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on hosts communicating over an IP network. TCP is widely used for applications that require guaranteed delivery, such as web browsing, email, and file transfers.
