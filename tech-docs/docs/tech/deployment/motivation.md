# Motivation

As engineers, we all know the feeling of being in a perfect flow state,
that deep zone where problems make sense, ideas connect, and
time doesn’t exist.

And we also know the frustration when something breaks that flow,
jumping between Google, GitHub issues and ChatGPT just to recall something
that you had already solved once.

`Every hour you spend debugging something become more valuable,
if you document what you learned`

This workshop is built around that idea. It’s not just about learning Docker,
Kubernetes or DevOps tools. It’s about capturing knowledge, reducing mental load
, and helping you stay in your flow state more often when learning DevOps.

`If my past debugging pain can save you even 30 minutes tomorrow, then this workshop
purpose is achieved.`
