# Motivation

1. As engineers, we all know the feeling of being in a perfect flow state,
   that deep zone where problems make sense, ideas connect, and
   time doesn’t exist.
2. And we also know the frustration when something breaks that flow,
   jumping between Google, GitHub issues and ChatGPT just to figure out things.
3. This workshop is built around by capturing real world project learnings
   & equip you with solid understanding on why things work the way they do
   (learnt from
   painful hours of debugging).

`If this workshop helps you gain skills that make your life easier, then its
purpose is fulfilled.`
