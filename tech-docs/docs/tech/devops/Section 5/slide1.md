# Recap

1. In the previous sections, we covered various fundamental concepts of
   DevOps and Kubernetes.
2. We started with the history of how DevOps came into existence and its core
   principles.
3. We talked about why containerization is important and how it helps in modern
   application deployment.
4. We explored Docker, its architecture, its components and how to create and
   manage Docker containers.
5. We then moved on to Kubernetes (K8s), understanding its architecture,
   components, and how it orchestrates containerized applications.
6. We discussed K8s objects like Pods, Deployments, Services, namespaces, env,
   config Maps, Secrets, scaling and how they are used to manage applications
   in a K8s cluster.
7. Finally, we deployed sample applications on a local K8s cluster and saw how
   to manage them effectively.

## What's Next?

1. Next, we will focus on how to deploy applications on cloud platforms using
   managed Kubernetes services like Azure AKS.
2. We will use Github pipelines to automate the deployment process to these cloud
   platforms.
