# About Me

1. I am Sathishkumar, a BioCoder (😛 Don't think too much about it, my school
   major is Biology)
2. I did my High School major in Biology & completed engineering in
   Electronics & Communication Engineering.
3. Got introduced to C programming during my 1st semester
   & got fascinated by coding.
4. Till my 3rd year, I was thinking people C programming is the only thing
   in software world.
5. After joining Soliton, I got introduced LabView &
   Web Development.
6. I was amazed by how web works & started learning more about it (You know the feeling
   when you get to know something new & feel this is it).

## My Tech Journey

1. Started my career as Frontend developer working on
   HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS, Angular, TypeScript, React Js &
   Vue Js.
2. Later got interested in backend development & started learning Node Js,
   Express Js, & databases like MongoDB, MySQL & Postgres
3. After working as Fullstack developer for quite sometime, I got opportunity
   to explore Cloud & DevOps engineer.
4. Started learning Cloud platforms like Azure along with DevOps tools like Docker,
   Kubernetes, GitHub Actions etc.,
5. Had hands-on experience in working for enterprise projects & high scale applications.

## Values I believe

Values I hold close to my heart is

1. Write good code that is easy to read, maintain & scale.
2. Bad code cause global warming - I have my own theory 😛
3. I like the concept of `Known knowns, Known unknowns & Unknown unknowns`
   & try to minimize the `Unknown unknowns` by learning new things.
